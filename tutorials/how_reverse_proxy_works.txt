How Reverse Proxy Works

Imagine A is User/Client, B is Proxy, and C is Website, and they are set up in a diagram like so:

A -sees-> B -sees-> C

A Forward Proxy is where the client A is trying to access and sees C, but does not know of the hidden proxy B.

A Reverse Proxy is where the client A is trying to access C, but sees the proxy B and does not know the location of C and assumes seeing C
